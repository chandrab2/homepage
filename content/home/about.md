Hi!! I am a Senior Research Scientist at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/). My primary research interests are in commonsense reasoning and natural language generation, with broad interests at the intersection of commonsense and vision. I was a co-recipient of the AAAI Outstanding paper award in 2020. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) in Evanston and B.Tech at the [National Institute of Technology (Allahabad)](http://www.mnnit.ac.in/) in India.
